# Neural-Network-Grad-Project
Python: This project implements a multi-label text classification model using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines embeddings, CNNs, bidirectional GRUs, and an attention mechanism. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, tokenization with DistilRoBERTa, custom layers such as GlobalSumPooling1D, and training with techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, learning-rate decay, and early stopping. The repository contains all code for training, evaluating, and generating predictions on the test dataset, along with a Colab notebook that documents the full workflow. The goal of the project is to improve upon a baseline model and achieve strong performance on a multi-label emotion classification task.
