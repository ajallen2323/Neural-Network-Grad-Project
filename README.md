# Neural-Network-Grad-Project
This project builds a multi-label text classification model using embeddings, CNNs, BiGRUs, and an attention layer. It includes data preprocessing, tokenization with DistilRoBERTa, training with regularization and learning-rate decay, and a prediction pipeline for generating test submissions.
